# Data Creation

In this directory all files associated with creating the mono- and multi-temporal dataset are located.

- `dataset_pipeline.py`: This file contains the classes used in `pipeline.ipynb`.
- `pipeline.ipynb`: Notebook with all steps which were done to create both datasets. Also some figures were taken created here.
- `unet_pipeline`: This files contains the script for the auxilliary U-Net.

Note: In order to execute the code, the original images from the Weimar experiment are necessary.
